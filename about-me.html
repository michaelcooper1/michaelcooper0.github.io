	<p>My name is Michael. I am 14 years old and go to San Lorenzo High school. My favorite food is Mexican Food. My favorite color is green. I have 1 little sister and my birthday is July 12th. My favorite player is lebron james as u can see.</p>
	<p>An embarrasing story about me is that when i was in 4th grade. It was a fire drill as I was going to the bathroom. And the fire drill was long, and I really had to pee, so I pee'd on my self. I didn't tell anyone and went through 2 hours with pee on my underwear until it was time to go home. </p>
